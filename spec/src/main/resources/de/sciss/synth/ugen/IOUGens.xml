                A UGen that writes a signal onto a bus, delaying the signal such that the input will begin to appear
                on the bus precisely when the encompassing Synth was scheduled according to its OSC bundle.
                I.e. if the synth is scheduled to be started part way through a control cycle, `OffsetOut` will
                maintain the correct offset by buffering the output and delaying it until the exact time that the
                synth was scheduled for.

                This UGen adds ("mixes") the input-signal to the existing contents of the bus.

                Multi-channel input signals, for example a `PanAz`, are written as such to the bus without expansion.
                That is, the `bus` index argument is used for the first channel, the second channel will appear on
                `bus + 1`, etc.

                If you have an expanding multi-channel input, however, you have to be careful. For example, if you
                have `PanAz.ar(2, SinOsc.ar(Seq(444, 555, 666)) * 0.2, Seq(-1, 0, 1))`, this results in one output
                UGen carrying one channel, and another one carrying two channels. (The way this works is consistent
                with SCLang). In order to get the correct behaviour (left outputs of the `PanAz` summed, and right
                output of the `PanAz` summed), wrap this expression in a `Mix(...)` before passing it to the output
                UGen.

                '''Note''': You cannot currently achieve sample accurate scheduling in SuperCollider. This UGen is
                therefore more or less useless.

                A UGen that reads buses that are local to the enclosing synth. These buses should be written
                using a `LocalOut` ugen. They behave like regular buses, but are more convenient for the
                implementation of a self contained effect that uses a feedback processing loop.

                In a synth, there can be only each one control-rate and audio-rate `LocalIn`/`LocalOut` pair.
                The signal written to a `LocalOut` will not be read by the `LocalIn` until the next
                control block cycle, introducing a delay of `ControlDur`.

                '''Warning''': The argument has been changed `numChannels: Int` in version 1.15.3 to `init: GE`
                in version 1.16.0. The previous version was incompatible with SuperCollider 3.6.x.
                A previous usage such as `LocalIn.ar(2)` to create two channels must now be expressed
                as `LocalIn.ar(Seq(0, 0))`!

                A UGen that replace the contents of a bus with an input signal. Other than `Out`, the signal
                is not added to the previous contents of the bus but replaces it, allowing for a simple way of
                an "insert" effect.

                Multi-channel input signals, for example a `PanAz`, are written as such to the bus without expansion.
                That is, the `bus` index argument is used for the first channel, the second channel will appear on
                `bus + 1`, etc.

                If you have an expanding multi-channel input, however, you have to be careful. For example, if you
                have `PanAz.ar(2, SinOsc.ar(Seq(444, 555, 666)) * 0.2, Seq(-1, 0, 1))`, this results in one output
                UGen carrying one channel, and another one carrying two channels. (The way this works is consistent
                with SCLang). In order to get the correct behaviour (left outputs of the `PanAz` summed, and right
                output of the `PanAz` summed), wrap this expression in a `Mix(...)` before passing it to the output
                UGen.

                A UGen that reads a signal from a bus. Whether an audio- or control-bus is used depends on the rate of
                the UGen.

                `In.ar` and `In.kr` behave differently with respect to signals left on the bus in the previous
                calculation cycle (control block): `In.ar` can access audio signals that were generated in the
                current calculation cycle by synths appearing earlier in the node tree. It does not read signals
                produced by nodes in the previous calculation cycle (i.e. synths appearing later in the node tree),
                the input would instead be zero. To allow such "feedback", `InFeedback` can be used.

                In contrast, `In.kr` does not distinguish between "new" and "old" data: It will always read the
                most recent value found on the bus, whether it was generated earlier in this calculation cycle,
                left over from the last one, or set before by the client.


                '''Note''': The server uses the first `NumOutputBuses` channels to write to the sound card, followed
                by another `NumInputBuses` to read from the sound card. For convenience, the pseudo-UGens
                `PhysicalOut` and `PhysicalIn` can be used.

            <text>
                A UGen which reads a signal from an audio bus with a current or one cycle old timestamp.

                Audio buses adhere to the concept of a cycle timestamp, which increases for each audio block
                calculated. When the various output ugens (`Out`, `OffsetOut`, `XOut`) write data to a bus,
                they mix it with any data from the current cycle, but overwrite any data from the previous cycle.
                (`ReplaceOut` overwrites all data regardless.) Thus depending on node order and what synths are
                writing to the bus, the data on a given bus may be from the current cycle or be one cycle old at
                the time of reading.

                `In.ar` checks the timestamp of any data it reads in and zeros any data from the previous
                cycle (for use within that node; the data remains on the bus). This is fine for audio data,
                as it avoids feedback, but for control data it is useful to be able to read data from any place
                in the node order. For this reason `In.kr` also reads data that is older than the current cycle.

                In some cases one might also want to read audio from a node later in the current node order.
                This can be achieved with `InFeedback`. It reads from the previous cycle, and hence introduces
                a '''delay''' of one block size, which by default is 64 sample frames (equal to about 1.45 ms
                at 44.1 kHz sample rate).

                '''Note''' that no delay occurs when the bus contains a signal which has been written already
                in the current cycle. The delay is only introduced when no present signal exists.

                A UGen which generates a trigger anytime a control bus is set.

                Any time the bus is "touched" i.e. has its value set (using `"/c_set"` etc.), a single
                impulse trigger will be generated. Its amplitude is the value that the bus was set to.
                Note that if a signal is continuously written to that bus, for instance using
                `Out.kr`, only one initial trigger is generated once that ugen starts writing, but
                no successive triggers are generated.
