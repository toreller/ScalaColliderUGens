/** The main trait used in synthesis graph, a graph element, abbreviated as `GE`.
  *
  * Graph elements are characterized by having a calculation rate (possibly unknown),
  * and they embody future UGens, which are created by invoking the `expand` method.
  * For each ugen in SuperCollider, there is a corresponding graph element defined
  * in the `ugen` package, and these elements take again graph elements as arguments.
  * Multi-channel expansion is thus deferred to the transition from `SynthGraph` to `UGenGraph`.
  *
  * Currently, also a lot of unary and binary operations are directly defined on the `GE` trait,
  * although they might go into a separate `GEOps` implicit class in future versions.
